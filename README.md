# mineos-market-web

Fuckass frontend for [MineOS](https://github.com/IgorTimofeev/MineOS) Market built on Next.js and [mineos-market-js](https://github.com/dnrovs/mineos-market-js).

As I don't have any JS library or API for OCIF images to convert them, you will see a picture of Kamala Hairless as a placeholder.
